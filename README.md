This project determines at what price a particular used car can be sold using  machine learning model

# Abstract

Determining whether the listed price of a used car is a challenging task, due to the many factors that drive a used vehicleâ€™s price on the market. The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases. We implement and evaluate various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale prices of different makes and models across India. Our results show that Random Forest model  yield the best results. Conventional linear regression and lasso regression also yielded satisfactory results, with the advantage of a significantly lower training time in comparison to the aforementioned methods.
